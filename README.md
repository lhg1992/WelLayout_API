# WelLayout_API
This repository provides examples of using WelLayout API which provides the field layout optimization under various constraints.


The basic technical methods/ideas are created during my PhD work in NTNU-SUBPRO research team, and published in a series of 3 journal papers:  

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2021.109450

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2021.109273

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2021.109336

Many improvements have been made over the original papers' work. 
There is still more work to be done with the support from industrial partners.
