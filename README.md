# WelLayout_API
This repository provides examples of using WelLayout API which provides the field layout optimization under various constraints.


The basic technical methods/ideas are created during my PhD work in NTNU-SUBPRO research team, and published in a series of 3 journal papers:  

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2021.109450

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2021.109273

https://doi.org/10.1016/j.petrol.2021.109336

Many improvements have been made over the original papers' work. 
There is still more work to be done with the support from industrial partners.

Here shows some examples of the optimization results:  
Single well trajectory under various constraints:
